# a-dying-glimmer
You are a space explorer who has just crash landed on an unknown planet. In your crash, you shattered the planet's light, its source of life, scattering it all across the planet. You must complete challenges, puzzles, and battles to reconstruct the light source before time runs out, and all life is lost.
